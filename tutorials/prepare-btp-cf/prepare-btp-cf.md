### Configure the entitlements

In this section, you will set up the SAP BTP Cloud Foundry runtime for deploying CAP applications.

**Prerequisite:** You must have an administrator role for SAP BTP.

To deploy the Incident Management applications, you need the following entitlements:

| Service     |      Plan      |  Quota required |
| ------------- | :-----------: | ----: |
| Cloud Foundry runtime | free (Environment) |   1 |
| SAP Build Work Zone, standard edition    |  free (Application)    |   1 |
| SAP HANA Cloud |   hana-free    |   1 |
| SAP HANA Cloud |   tools (Application)   |   1 |
| SAP HANA Schemas & HDI Containers |   hdi-shared   |   1 |
| SAP Continuous Integration and Delivery | free (Application) |   1 |

Follow the steps below to add the entitlements.

1. Log in to SAP BTP cockpit.

2. Navigate to your subaccount and choose **Entitlements** &rarr; **Configure Entitlements**.

3. Choose **Add Service Plans**.

      <!-- border; size:540px --> ![Add service plans](./entitlements1.png)

2. Search for **Cloud Foundry Runtime** and select the **free (Environment)** plan.

      <!-- border; size:540px --> ![Add Cloud Foundry](./entitlements2.png)

2. Search for **SAP Build Work Zone, standard edition** and select the **free (Application)** plan.

      <!-- border; size:540px --> ![Add Work Zone](./entitlements3.png)

3. Search for **SAP HANA Cloud** and select the **tools (Application)** service plan and **hana-free** service plan.

      <!-- border; size:540px --> ![Add HANA](./entitlements4.png)

4. Search for **SAP HANA Schemas & HDI containers** and select the **hdi-shared** service plan.

      <!-- border; size:540px --> ![Add HANA HDI](./entitlement5.png)

5. Search for **SAP Continuous Integration & Delivery**, select the **free (Application)** plan, and choose **Add 6 Service Plans**.

      <!-- border; size:540px --> ![Add CI/CD](./entitlement6.png)

6. Choose **Save**.

<!-- Assign Entitlements end -->

### Enable Cloud Foundry Runtime

This creates a Cloud Foundry (CF) Org in your subaccount. Thereâ€™s always one Cloud Foundry org per subaccount. Later on, when you log on to Cloud Foundry, it asks you which Cloud Foundry org you want to log on to. For any development in your subaccount, you need to choose this org for your subaccount.

2. Navigate to your subaccount and choose **Enable Cloud Foundry**.

      <!-- border; size:540px --> ![enable CF](./enable-cf.png) 

3. In the **Enable Cloud Foundry** popup, change the values for **Instance Name** and **Org Name** as needed and choose **Create**.

      <!-- border; size:540px --> ![enable CF popup](./enable-cf-popup.png) 

3. Navigate to **Cloud Foundry** &rarr; **Spaces** and choose **Create Space**.

      <!-- border; size:540px --> ![Create space](./cf-createspace.png)

4. Enter a space name (for example, **dev**) and choose **Create**.

      <!-- border; size:540px --> ![Create space popup](./cf-createspace-popup.png)

<!-- Set Up HANA Cloud start -->

### Create an SAP HANA Cloud service instance

SAP HANA Cloud is used as a persistence layer.

> If you already have an SAP HANA Cloud instance in your subaccount, directly navigate to **Step: Map an existing SAP HANA Cloud service instance below**.

Follow these steps to create an SAP HANA Cloud service instance in the SAP BTP cockpit:

1. In the SAP BTP cockpit, navigate to your subaccount.

2. Choose **Cloud Foundry** &rarr; **Spaces**.

3. Choose the space where you want to deploy the Incident Management application.

      <!-- border; size:540px --> ![Space tile](./space-tile.png)

4. Choose **SAP HANA Cloud**.

5. Choose **Create** &rarr; **SAP HANA database**. The SAP HANA Cloud Central tool opens.

      <!-- border; size:540px --> ![Create SAP HANA DB](./create-hana-db0.png)

6. Sign in with your SAP BTP cockpit username/e-mail.

7. Choose **SAP HANA Cloud**, **SAP HANA Database**, and then choose **Next Step**.

      <!-- border; size:540px --> ![Create SAP HANA DB Step 1](./create-hana-db1.png)

8. The values in the **Organization** and **Space** dropdown menus will be filled automatically. In the **Instance Name** field, enter the **incident-management**.

9. In the **Administrator Password** and **Confirm Administrator Password** fields, enter a password for DBADMIN. Choose **Next Step**.

      <!-- border; size:540px --> ![Create SAP HANA DB Step 2](./create-hana-db2.png)

10. The default settings should be sufficient for the Incident Management application. Choose **Next Step**.

11. At **SAP HANA Database Availability Zone and Replicas**, choose again **Next Step**.

12. Select the **Allow all IP addresses** radio button, and choose **Review and Create** to review your SAP HANA Cloud instance configuration.

      <!-- border; size:540px --> ![Create SAP HANA DB Step 3](./create-hana-db3.png)

13. Choose **Create Instance**.

The creation of the database instance can take some minutes to complete. The final result looks like this in SAP BTP cockpit:

> Your SAP HANA Cloud service instance will be automatically stopped overnight, according to the server region time zone. That means you need to restart your instance every day before you start working with it.
> You can either use SAP BTP cockpit or the terminal in the SAP Business Application Studio to restart the stopped instance:
>
> ```bash
> cf update-service incident-management -c '{"data":{"serviceStopped":false}}'
> ```

### Map an existing SAP HANA Cloud service instance

1. Go to SAP HANA Cloud Central. If you have closed it, open it again by following these steps: 

      - In the SAP BTP cockpit, navigate to your subaccount.
      - Choose **Cloud Foundry** &rarr; **Spaces**.
      - Choose the Space where you want to deploy the Incident Management application.
      - Choose **SAP HANA Cloud**.
      - Choose **Manage SAP HANA Cloud**. The SAP HANA Cloud Central tool opens.

2. On the **All Instances** page, choose the **incident-management** instance.

3. Choose **Create Mapping**.

4. In the **Add Mapping** wizard:

      - In the **Org ID** dropdown menu, select your Cloud Foundry organization.
      - In the **Space ID** dropdown menu, select your Cloud Foundry space.

5. Choose **Add**. You have your incident-management SAP HANA database instance mapped to Cloud Foundry.

    > For more information, see [Map an SAP HANA Database to another Environment Context](https://help.sap.com/docs/HANA_CLOUD/9ae9104a46f74a6583ce5182e7fb20cb/1683421d02474567a54a81615e8e2c48.html) to add a new Cloud foundry or Kyma mapping.
